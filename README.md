The main pipeline of the system works on a singular directional system flow; this refers to the algorithm getting input from the users in form of an array of ingredients and receiving top 3 recipes they can cook using them. The matching and ranking of recipes with respect to ingredients displayed a use case for natural language processing during the training process for the algorithm. A large amount of data was to be collected for the process of training manually from various food blogging websites. To make the API integrate with the algorithm for outputting back to the client, we also required a web server that can be integrated easily into the system.

The working process of the whole project is divided into four steps.
a.  Data mining and web scraping 
b.  Data cleaning, modelling, and training
c.  Backend server for API routing to the algorithm
d.  Front end web application to host a prototype of the project
